@article{BBA,
	Abstract = {Agile businesses must be able to quickly adapt to changing requirements. In software development,
changing requirements often entails a repetition of development tasks such as implementation or testing.
To accelerate such tasks, model-driven engineering (MDE) offers users to express their requirements
as domain models and to automatically generate code from these models. Yet, most MDE approaches
require users need to learn new tools and languages and thus, MDE has found little adoption beyond a
few niches. As a result, most code is still written by hand, which is slow, costly, and error-prone.
In this paper, we propose an approach to using existing business artifacts as models in software
development. These models can be either transformed into executable code, or they can be used as
functional modules using an interpreter. This approach allows product owners to update requirements
with their existing tools and have them reflected in the software immediately, which drastically increases
business agility. We validate our approach by automatically transforming existing business logic and
domain data encoded in an Excel document into a web service and generating a web-based user interface
for it.},

	Abstract = {Operating a laser diode in an extended cavity which provides frequency-selective feedback is a very effective method of reducing the laser's linewidth and improving its tunability. We have developed an extremely simple laser of this type, built from inexpensive commercial components with only a few minor modifications. A 780~nm laser built to this design has an output power of 80~mW, a linewidth of 350~kHz, and it has been continuously locked to a Doppler-free rubidium transition for several days.},
